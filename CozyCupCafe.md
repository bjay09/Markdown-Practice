 A caffe latte, or latte for short, is an espresso-based coffee drink. As far as what is in a latte, the popular drink consists of espresso, steamed milk and a thin layer of milk foam. The classic latte ratio is one-third espresso to two-thirds steamed milk, although coffee shops and recipes often use more milk to create a rich and creamy beverage with a subtle espresso flavor.
